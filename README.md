# FindMeAHotel website

##[HTML & CSS Capstone]

This website was created for my HTML & CSS capstone Microverse project. 
In this project, I built a webpage using only html and css and no framework or preprocessor.
It is a simple webpage which is to serve as a hotel directory website, where people living within the sabon-gari area of kano state Nigeria can use to search for hotels when thhey want to lodge.
Basically it has 3 pages:

- the main page, from where you can search for hotels.
- the search result page, where the result of available hotels are returned.
- the details page, where more details of a particular hotel is displayed.

#### Mobile view of the main page
